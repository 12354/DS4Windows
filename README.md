# DS4Windows

Like those other ds4tools, but sexier.

DS4Windows is an extract anywhere program that allows you to get the best
DualShock 4 experience on your PC. By emulating a Xbox 360 controller, many
more games are accessible.

This project is a fork of the work of Jays2Kings. You can find the old project
website at [ds4windows.com](http://ds4windows.com).

- Microsoft 360 Driver (link inside DS4Windows, already installed by Windows if
you've used a 360 controller before)

## Device Detection Issue

If your DS4 is not detected by DS4Windows and the lightbar continues to
flash yellow, there is a chance that Exclusive Mode has permanently
disabled your DS4 in Windows. The easiest way to test if this has happened is
for you to plug in the controller into a different USB port and see if it
works then. Although this problem mainly affected older versions of
DS4Windows (text written after version 1.5.15) for various reasons,
other mapping programs can cause the same problem to occur.

If you suspect that your DS4 has been disabled, open the Device Manager
(Control Panel\Hardware and Sound\Device Manager) and look for devices listed
under the path "Human Interface Devices\HID-compliant game controller".

If the icon shown for a device has a down arrow icon then you should
check the device's device instance path and see if the device is a
DualShock 4 device. Right click the device item and select "Enable device"
from the menu. That will re-enable the device and be seen by applications
again.
